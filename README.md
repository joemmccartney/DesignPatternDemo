# Design Pattern Demonstration

The program deomonstrates the Strategy and Factory design patterns within object-oriented programming. Instances of Humanoids are created using concrete factories and these instances are assigned specific strategies based on which factory is used. These strategies are designed in such a way that it is very easy to implement a new strategy and not break any code previously based on the program.

## Getting Started

The program consists of three small .py files, so ideally you should be able to run it in any standard Python environment. The Spyder ver. 3.3.3 IDE was used for development.
